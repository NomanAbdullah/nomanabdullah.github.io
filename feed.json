Meanwhile, the site generates the cryptographically strong random value or the token for the session and set this as a cookie on the user's browser and that is distinguished from the session id. Since the server doesn't need to save the value in its end, the pattern is also called stateless <strong>CSRF</strong> defence.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Following that, the site requires every request to include this random value as a hidden value or another request parameter. For this reason, an attacker is not able to read any data transmitted from the server or modify the cookie values.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">For this scenario, the mitigation method is to retrive the <strong>CSRF</strong> cookie from the response and add it into a special header to all the requests.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://nomanabdullah.github.io/media/posts/7/002.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"803\" height=\"437\"></p>\n<p><strong>A simple web application</strong></p>\n<p>Before getting started, my github repository have to be cloned. The link is given here, [<i><a href=\"https://github.com/NomanAbdullah/csrf-double-submit-cookie-pattern\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">my github link</a></i>] </p>\n<p>This web application is developed using PHP &amp; JS. An username and password is need to login to the application. For this application, the credentials are hardcoded (<strong>username: noman, password: noman</strong>)</p>\n<p id=\"199e\"><img src=\"https://nomanabdullah.github.io/media/posts/7/Screenshot-299.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1360\" height=\"667\"></p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">User credentials in the login form is submitted using a POST methid. When the user is logged in successfully, server side will created a unique session id and a token but unlike STP, server only stores the session id in this method.</p>\n<p>Following that server responses the corresponding token along with the response body. The generates session id and the server response token set cookies in the user's web browser.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://nomanabdullah.github.io/media/posts/7/Screenshot-297.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1349\" height=\"677\"></p>\n<p>After logging in, the user will be redirected to status update page. In this page, an AJAX call(self-call) is implemented to get the stored <strong>CSRF</strong> token from the browser cookies.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://nomanabdullah.github.io/media/posts/7/Screenshot-293.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"877\" height=\"162\"></p>\n<p>Now, the corresponding <strong>CSRF</strong> token is added to the hidden field as following:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://nomanabdullah.github.io/media/posts/7/Screenshot-292.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"665\" height=\"248\"></p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">A POST request is implemented to update user status. This request consists of the generated token and the session cookie.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://nomanabdullah.github.io/media/posts/7/Screenshot-291.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1342\" height=\"675\"></p>\n<p>After adding some value when user clicks on \"Update\" button, the POST request is sent. Meanwhile, the cookie hearder is validated by the server for session id as well as server compares the token from request body which is a hidden value against the token from header cookie.</p>\n<p>If both tokens are matched, the server accepts the request as follows:</p>\n<p><img style=\"font-size: inherit;\" src=\"https://nomanabdullah.github.io/media/posts/7/Screenshot-294.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1243\" height=\"127\"></p>\n<p>Else the server will show following error:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://nomanabdullah.github.io/media/posts/7/Screenshot-298.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"677\" height=\"68\"></p>\n<p><strong>Why the method is safe?</strong></p>\n<p>With every request cookies are sent autometically, regardless of whether the request was initiated by the original website or by a third party website. That’s why a cookie alone does not suffice as every request will contain it.</p>\n<p id=\"e875\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">But by having the token also in the request itself, an attacking site cannot generate valid requests any more as they can’t get hold on the user’s token.</p>\n<p> Thank you for reading this post. Hope, this will help to implement Double Submit Cookie Pattern in web applications.</p>",

To prevent this attack, I am trying to implement one of the solutions called Synchronizer Token Pattern in this blog. A simple web application is created in this regard.</p>\n<p><strong>Synchronizer Token Pattern (STP)</strong></p>\n<p>This is a method where a secret, token and unique value for each request, is embedded by the web application in all HTML forms and verified on server side.
